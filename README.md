# mdcs-py

The Mosaic Dataset Configuration Script (MDCS) is a Python script that reads parameters stored in an xml file in order to create, configure, and populate a [mosaic dataset](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/what-is-a-mosaic-dataset.htm).

If you want to try out MDCS, review the documentation included in the repo for instructions, and download the suggested sample data from [ArcGIS Online](http://pm.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=5f6c9a157ffc45c4863996c2987f4ac9). 

## Features

* Automate the creation of multiple mosaic datasets
* Configure multiple mosaic datasets using XML files
* Built-in verbose reporting and logging system
* Command line usage via batch files 

## Instructions

1. Download the ZIP file (called mdcs-py-master.zip)
2. Create a folder called Image_Mgmt_Workflows in the root of your C: drive
3. Unzip the contents of the MDCS ZIP file into the Image_Mgmt_Workflows folder
