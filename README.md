# mdcs-py

The Mosaic Dataset Configuration Script (MDCS) is a Python script that reads parameters stored in an xml file in order to create, configure, and populate a [mosaic dataset](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/what-is-a-mosaic-dataset.htm).

If you want to try out MDCS, review the documentation included in the repo for instructions, and download the suggested sample data from [ArcGIS Online](http://pm.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=5f6c9a157ffc45c4863996c2987f4ac9).

* Compatible with ArcMap 10.1 - 10.6.1 and ArcGIS Pro 1.0 - 2.2

## Instructions

1. Download the ZIP file (called mdcs-py-master.zip)
